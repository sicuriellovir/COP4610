Contents of the Tar Archive: 

Part 1 folder
	empty.c empty C program
	part1.c copy of empty.c with seven system calls
		empty.trace the use of a strace is to check if we added correctly the system calls
	part1.trace the use of a strace is to check if we added
		correctly the system calls, so when part1.c is called it produces 7 system calls.
Part 2 folder
	my_timer.c kernel module to call current_kernel_time() and 
		stores the time value.
	Makefile makefile to compile my_timer.c
Part 3 folder
